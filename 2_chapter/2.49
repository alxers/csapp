A. For a floating-point format with an n-bit fraction, give a formula for the
smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly (because it
would require an n+1-bit fraction to be exact). Assume the exponent field
size k is large enough that the range of representable exponents does not
provide a limitation for this problem.

B. What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format
(n = 23)?
