Write a function div16 that returns the value x/16 for integer argument x. Your function should not use division, modulus, multiplication, any conditionals (if or ?:), any comparison operators (e.g. <, >, or ==), or any loops. You may assume that data type int is 32 bits long and uses a two's-complement representation, and that right shifts are performed arithmetically.

For 16 = 2^4 it's x >> 4 (wrong)
(find cases when this does not work)
