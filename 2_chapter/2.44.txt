Assume it's 32-bit machine using two's-complement. Right shifts performed arithmetically for signed values and logically for unsigned values.

int x = foo(); // Arbitrary value
int y = bar(); // Arbitrary value

unsigned ux = x;
unsigned uy = y;

For each of the following C expressions, either argume that it is true (evaluates to 1) for all values of x and y, or give values of x and y for which it is false.

A. (x > 0) || (x-1 < 0)
B. (x & 7) !=7 || (x<<29 < 0)
C. (x * x) >= 0
D. x < 0 || -x <= 0
