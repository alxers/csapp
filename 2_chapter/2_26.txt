Determine whether one string is longer than another.

size_t strlen(const char *s);


int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
  return strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0;
}

(size_t is defined to be usigned int)

A. For what cases will this function produce an incorrect result?
strlen(0) - strlen(1) = -1 (unsigned), so it would be 2^31

B. Explain how this incorrect result comes about.
We compare 2^31 and 0 as unsigned

C. Show how to fix the code so that it will work reliably.
(int) strlen(s) - (int) strlen(t) > 0;
