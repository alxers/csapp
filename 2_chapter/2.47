Consider a 5-bit floating-point representation based on the IEEE floating-point
format, with one sign bit, two exponent bits (k = 2), and two fraction bits (n = 2).
The exponent bias is 2^(2−1) − 1 = 1.
The table that follows enumerates the entire nonnegative range for this 5-bit
floating-point representation. Fill in the blank table entries using the following
directions:
