LEA instruction can perform computation of the form (a << k) + b, where k is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, and b is either 0 or some program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform multiplications by constant factors. F.e. 3 * a can be computed as (a << 1) + a.

Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all possible values of k, what multiples of a can be computed with a single LEA instruction?
