For the case where data type int has 32 bits, devise a version of tmult_ok that uses the 64-bit precision of data type long long, without using division.

int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {
	x = (long long)x;
	y = (long long)y;
	long long p = x * y;
	// If casting "p" back to 32-bit changes the value, then it overflows
	return !x || p == (int)p;
}
